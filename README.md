# daily-routine
I would like to share with you my daily routine, which will inspire you and which will help me raise the level of the English language.

         Thank you for continuing to read. My morning starts at 4:00 am when my phone rings and I get out of bed. I go to the bathroom, take a shower, and perform ablution. I pray two rak'ahs and then prepare myself to go to the mosque at 4:45 am ,Then I pray the dawn prayer. I read the Qur’an and return home, and at home to the mosque I photograph the sunrise. On your iPhone, start arranging your daily routine.
